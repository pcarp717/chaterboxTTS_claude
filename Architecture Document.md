Architecture Document: ChatterboxTTS Desktop

1. Introduction

This document outlines the technical architecture for the ChatterboxTTS Desktop application. It is based on the requirements specified in the PRD and is intended to guide the development team. The architecture prioritizes performance on the target hardware (NVIDIA RTX 3080), efficient resource management, and a modular design.

2. High-Level Architecture

The system will be a standalone Windows 11 desktop application. For rapid UI development and easy integration with the Python-based TTS engine, a locally served web UI (using Gradio or a minimal FastAPI/Flask backend with an HTML/JS frontend) is the recommended approach21212121. All core model inference will happen locally on the GPU.

2.2. Core Dependencies

TTS Engine: chatterbox-tts>=0.1.2
Audio Processing: librosa>=0.10.0, soundfile>=0.12.0, torchaudio>=2.0.0
GPU & Resource Management: torch (with CUDA), psutil>=5.9.0, nvidia-ml-py>=12.0.0
GUI Framework: gradio (recommended starting point) or PyQt6

3. Resource Management Architecture


3.1. Model Lifecycle & Caching

The application must efficiently manage the Chatterbox model, which requires ~6.5 GB of VRAM during inference22222222.

Smart Loading: The model will not be loaded on application startup. Instead, it will be loaded into GPU VRAM on the first "Generate" request23.


Adaptive Caching: The loaded model will remain cached in VRAM for a default of 5 minutes after the last generation request. This duration will be user-configurable (1-15 minutes)24.


Idle Unloading: A background thread managed by the ModelManager will monitor the time since last use. If the cache duration expires, the model will be unloaded from VRAM, and
torch.cuda.empty_cache() will be called to free the memory25.


Memory Monitoring: The Resource Manager will actively monitor VRAM usage via nvidia-ml-py. If usage exceeds a threshold (e.g., 85%), it can trigger an automatic unload of the model to prevent system instability.

3.2. Performance Optimizations

GPU Prioritization: The application will explicitly load the model to the CUDA device (ChatterboxTTS.from_pretrained(device="cuda")) and will only fall back to the CPU if a compatible GPU is not detected26.


PyTorch Compilation: To maximize inference speed on the RTX 3080, the application will use torch.compile() on the model during the initial loading process. This has been reported to yield significant speedups27.


Mixed Precision: The option to use half-precision (FP16) will be explored to potentially reduce memory usage and further increase speed, though initial development will target the default FP32 to ensure stability28.

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Windows 10/11
- Python 3.11 or later
- NVIDIA RTX 3080 (or compatible GPU) for optimal performance

### Quick Start

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Desktop App**:
   
   **Windows (Recommended)**:
   ```bash
   run_desktop.bat
   ```
   
   **Or manually**:
   ```bash
   venv\Scripts\python.exe app\main.py
   ```

3. **WSL Users**: 
   - Install X server (VcXsrv, X410)
   - Set DISPLAY environment variable
   - Or run from Windows PowerShell instead

### Testing the Installation
```bash
python test_ui.py
```

## Application Interface

### Main Panel (Left)
- **Text Input**: Large text area with character counter (10,000 character limit)
- **Voice Selection**: Dropdown to choose between default and custom voices
- **Voice Settings**: Sliders for exaggeration (emotion level) and CFG weight
- **Generate Button**: Large, prominent button to start TTS generation
- **Export Controls**: WAV export functionality with native file dialogs

### System Panel (Right)
- **System Status Tab**: Real-time monitoring of:
  - Model loading status
  - Device (CUDA/CPU) information
  - RAM and VRAM usage percentages
  - Time since last model use
  
- **Voice Management Tab**: Tools for:
  - Adding new custom voices from audio files
  - Deleting existing custom voices
  - Viewing voice information and metadata

## Technical Features

### Performance Optimizations
- **Threaded Generation**: TTS runs in background thread to prevent UI freezing
- **Smart Memory Management**: Automatic model loading/unloading based on usage
- **GPU Acceleration**: Full CUDA support for RTX 3080 optimization
- **Efficient Audio Processing**: Direct tensor handling for optimal performance

### User Experience
- **Progress Feedback**: Visual progress bars during generation
- **Status Messages**: Color-coded status updates (success, error, info)
- **Responsive Design**: Resizable interface that adapts to different screen sizes
- **Native Look**: OS-appropriate styling and behavior

### Error Handling
- **Graceful Degradation**: Handles missing models, GPU issues, and file errors
- **User Feedback**: Clear error messages with actionable solutions
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Proper resource cleanup on application exit

## Comparison with Web Version

| Feature | Desktop (PyQt6) | Web (Gradio) |
|---------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Runtime** | Native executable | Browser-based |
| **Performance** | Direct system access | HTTP overhead |
| **File Access** | Native dialogs | Web file uploads |
| **System Integration** | Full Windows integration | Limited to browser |
| **Resource Usage** | Optimized native code | Browser + server |
| **Offline Usage** | Complete offline | Requires local server |
| **Multi-window** | Native window management | Single browser tab |
| **Notifications** | System notifications | Browser-only |

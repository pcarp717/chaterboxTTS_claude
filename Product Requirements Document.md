Product Requirements Document: ChatterboxTTS Desktop

1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the requirements for the ChatterboxTTS Desktop application, a lightweight yet powerful Windows 11 tool that leverages Resemble AI's Chatterbox TTS model. The application will provide fast, high-quality, and locally-processed text-to-speech generation. It is specifically designed for the NVIDIA RTX 3080 GPU, featuring efficient resource management, a user-friendly interface, and robust voice cloning capabilities.

2. Goals and Background Context

Goal 1: High-Quality Speech Generation. To convert input text into natural-sounding speech locally, leveraging the GPU for faster-than-real-time performance1. The output audio quality will be high, targeting 48kHz WAV as the primary format222.


Goal 2: Advanced Voice Customization. To allow users to select from various voices, including the ability to clone new voices from short audio samples provided by the user3.


Goal 3: Efficient Resource Management. To optimize model loading and GPU memory usage, ensuring the application does not monopolize system resources. This includes caching the model in VRAM and unloading it after periods of inactivity4.


Goal 4: User-Friendly and Offline Operation. To provide a simple, intuitive GUI for a single user, with all core TTS generation happening offline after the initial model download5555.


Chatterbox is a state-of-the-art, open-source TTS engine that rivals proprietary systems66. This application aims to harness its power on a local machine, giving users full control without relying on cloud services for generation. All generated audio will contain Resemble's imperceptible PerTh watermark to identify it as AI-generated, aligning with responsible AI practices7.


3. Core Features


3.1. Text-to-Speech Generation

A primary interface with a large text input area supporting up to 10,000 characters8.


A "Generate" button that initiates the TTS process, with a progress indicator showing the real-time status and estimated completion time9999.


An integrated audio player with waveform visualization for immediate playback of the generated speech10.


Automatic text chunking will be implemented for inputs over 300 characters to prevent audio quality degradation, a known issue with the model on longer passages111111111111111111.



3.2. Voice Management System

A voice selection menu with a default, natural-sounding voice and up to 10 slots for user-created custom voices12121212.


A workflow for users to create new voice clones by uploading a 7-20 second WAV or MP3 audio file of clear, single-speaker speech13. The system will provide guidelines for optimal quality14.


The ability to name, preview, and manage custom voice profiles, which will persist between sessions15.



3.3. Advanced Playback and Export

Playback controls including play, pause, stop, volume adjustment, and timeline scrubbing16161616.


Adjustable playback speed from 0.5x to 2.0x, implemented at the player level for immediate adjustment without regenerating audio17171717.


An option to export the final audio as a high-quality WAV (48kHz, 16-bit) or a compressed MP3 file18181818.



4. Success Metrics


4.1. Performance Targets

Model Load Time: < 15 seconds on an RTX 3080.
Generation Speed: 1.5x to 5x real-time for average text passages19191919.


VRAM Efficiency: < 7GB VRAM usage during generation to run comfortably on a 10GB RTX 308020202020.


Cache Hit Rate: > 80% for consecutive generation requests within a single session.

4.2. User Experience Goals

First Generation: < 20 seconds from application launch (including model load).
Subsequent Generations: < 5 seconds response time (with model cached).
Voice Creation: < 2 minutes for a user to upload a sample and create a new custom voice.
Resource Cleanup: Resource unloading should be automatic with no user intervention required.

5. Development Phases

Phase 1: Core MVP (4-6 weeks): Basic TTS generation, simple text input, audio playback, and foundational resource management.
Phase 2: Voice Management (2-3 weeks): Custom voice creation workflow, voice quality validation, and advanced playback controls.
Phase 3: Optimization & Polish (2-3 weeks): Performance tuning for the RTX 3080, UI/UX refinements, and robust error handling.
Phase 4: Future Features (TBD): Streaming playback for chunked audio, advanced voice mixing, and system-level integrations.

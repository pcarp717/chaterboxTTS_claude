UI/UX Specification: ChatterboxTTS Desktop

1. Introduction

This document outlines the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design for the ChatterboxTTS Desktop application. The design prioritizes simplicity, efficiency, and a clear, uncluttered workflow for a single user.

2. Overall Layout and Key Screens

The application will be presented in a single, unified window. The layout will be divided into three main sections: Input & Configuration, Generation Control, and Playback & Output.

3. User Flows


3.1. Flow: Generating Speech with Default Voice

User opens the application.
User pastes or types text into the Text Input Area.
User leaves the Voice Selection Dropdown on "Default".
User clicks the Generate Button.
System displays a progress bar and status updates. The model is loaded into VRAM if not already cached29.


Upon completion, the generated audio waveform appears in the Playback Section.
User can immediately play the audio using the playback controls.

3.2. Flow: Adding and Using a Custom Voice

User clicks the Manage Voices Button.
A dialog or new view appears showing custom voice slots.
User clicks "Add New Voice".
System prompts the user to upload a WAV or MP3 file (7-20 seconds) and provide a name for the voice30.


User selects an audio file and enters a name (e.g., "My Voice").
System validates the audio and saves the voice profile.
User closes the voice management view.
The new voice ("My Voice") is now available in the Voice Selection Dropdown.
User selects "My Voice" and clicks Generate to create speech with the cloned voice.

4. Component-Level Specifications

Text Input Area: A large, multi-line text field that is the main focus of the initial view.
Voice Dropdown: A standard dropdown menu. When a custom voice is selected, metadata (creation date, sample duration) could be displayed in a tooltip or a small adjacent text area.
Audio Player: Will feature a visual waveform to provide feedback and allow for easier scrubbing31. The timeline will be clickable for seeking. The speed slider will adjust the playback rate in real-time32.


Progress Indicator: Should be a determinate progress bar that fills as the text is processed, providing a more informative experience than an indeterminate spinner33.

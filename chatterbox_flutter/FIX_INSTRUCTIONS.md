# Flutter Fix Instructions

The dependency conflicts have been resolved. Here's what to do:

## Method 1: Run the cleanup script
```powershell
cd chatterbox_flutter
.\clean_and_setup.bat
```

## Method 2: Manual steps
```powershell
cd chatterbox_flutter
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter config --enable-windows-desktop
flutter run -d windows
```

## What was fixed:
1. Removed conflicting `material_color_utilities` dependency
2. Removed missing font and asset references  
3. Simplified dependencies to essential packages only
4. Removed `dynamic_color` and `bitsdojo_window` imports
5. Cleaned up main.dart to use standard Material Design 3

The 79 VS Code problems should disappear once you run `flutter pub get`.
